# CTF Strategy 2025

Welcome to Cyber skills 2025!

- [Intro](./lessons/01_intro.md)
- [Why CTF](./ctf-events/about_ctf.md)

---

## Focus for 2025

Training through walkthroughs. To always be planning for a CTF.

### Focus areas

1. Web exploitation; more
1. OSINT; do the challenges, this was well done in 2024 with little training
1. Python; more, use it where you can
1. AI exploitation; we are seeing some of these in CTFs now, so will look at some walkthroughs
1. Cryptography; very common, know the common challenges
1. Binaries; how to run them and strings them

---

### What we wont do

1. Networking and network forensics (we will still do web)
1. Reverse engineering (apart from `strings`)

---

## Setup

Ideally you can do this from school and home

### Accounts required

- [CTFTime](https://ctftime.org/)
  - A register of allot of CTFs we can do.
  - Please confirm with your teacher and parents before joining a CTF.
- [PicoCTF](https://www.picoctf.org/) - you will be provided with login details
  - great for training videos and challenges at all levels.
  - [about](./ctf-events/about_picoctf.md)
- [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/)
  - some 'simple' challenges but expects far more base knowledge
- [CTF101](https://ctf101.org/) - great for learning CTF skills

### CTF Attack station

- You can use your local system for some challenges, particularly if using online tools
- Kali linux will be needed for more hacker like challenges
