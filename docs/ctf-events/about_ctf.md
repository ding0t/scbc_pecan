## Objectives

1. [About CTF](#about-ctf)

## About CTF

Capture the flag challenges (CTF) - small challenges to demonstrate cyber concepts and flaws, to build cyber skills.

## Why CTF

Cyber security requires a problem solvers mindset. Some things can be automated, some can be made into processes, but to be on the leading edge one must learn the art of being a problem solver.

## Flags

A flag is text that is enetered to the CTF platform demonstrate you have solved the CTF.

⚠️ Be aware of any special formatting required

## Common challenge types

Most common is the _jeopardy_ style CTF, a collection of challenges to solve. With demonstration odf solution with a proof or flag that can be automatically marked. PECAN+ is a jeopardy style CTF.

Most challenges will fall into these catagories
