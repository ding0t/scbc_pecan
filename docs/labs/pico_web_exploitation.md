## where are the robots

An introduction to robots instructions.

<details>
<summary><b>Walkthrough</b></summary>

1. Load the [site](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/)
1. Ok it is a pretty simple site, lets have alook at the source to see if there is any more to it
```
CTRL+SHIFT+i
```
1. Yes - this confirms very simple site - so the challenge will probably be realted to the namesake.
1. We know about `robots.txt` - lets visit it
1. just add `\robots.txt` to the url...
1. Interesting - we have a Disallow what does that [mean](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/create-robots-txt)?
```txt
disallow: [At least one or more disallow or allow entries per rule] A directory or page, relative to the root domain, 
that you don't want the user agent to crawl. If the rule refers to a page, it must be the full page name as shown in the browser.
