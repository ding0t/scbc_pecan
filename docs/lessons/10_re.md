# Reverse Engineering

Reverse engineering is the process of discovering the way a binary works.

## Tools

1. `strings`
1. `objdump`

## Approaches

1. Static - the binary is not running
1. Dynamic- running the binary

### Static

1. Read source code
1. Look at strings
1. Inspect object
1. Decompiler


### Dynamic

Useful to tell what the code actually does, and allow some protections to execute, and deobfuscate code ionto memory

A great example of this is the pico challenge [Classic Crackme 0x100](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/409?category=3&page=1&search=crackme)
