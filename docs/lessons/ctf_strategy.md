# CTF strategy

### Prepare

1. Use tools to assist your work, know your core tools
1. Practice
1. Read the rules

### Collaborate

1. Communicate with your team!
1. Take notes; share them across your team
    - Prepare your notes before the CTF
    - have links to tools
1. Agree how to structure your notes in the team
    - per challenge notes
    - scratch space for personal working
1. Be aware of who is working on what challenge
    - add to notes per challenge

### Orient

1. Think of what type of problem this is 
1. Look for any hints
    - challenge name
    - attachment names
    - body
1. Focus on a solution - take time to think critically and plan an approach, write it down
1. Do targeted research
1. Take notes - always practice this. Write enough so that you can give the instructions to someone else to follow.

## Stuck?

1. Enjoy the challenge
1. Be persistant, but know when to move on
1. Reflect - what worked well, what would you do different?
1. get hints if available (see the rules to know what they cost)
1. Be aware of [cognitive bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases). 
    * Sometimes an assumption we have made may be incorrect 
    * re- read the question slowly. 
    * Go over your notes, re-read your planned aproach
